ONDC is an ambitious initiative to democratize digital commerce by creating a decentralized network of buyer apps and seller apps through an interoperable protocol specification. 
ONDC Protocol is maintained by the Open Source Community to create API specifications, schemas and taxonomy for Retail, Logistics and other domains.

Please go through theUI to view tags, enums, Attributes (Required/Optional), Flows and swagger specifications.

Participate in the community discussions to leverage ONDC Protocol as well as to contribute towards development of ONDC Protocol by providing ideas, reporting issues, contributing to documentation, and contributing code.

Please go through the Services - BRD as well, to understand the business requirements.
